Hi everyone! This game was inspired by a task in a CodeCademy course that I'm completing at the moment. I had to build a game with the same logic, but for the console only. I took it a bit forward and applied a cool UI(hop it's cool). This took few days, but I love a result so much. 

The best feeling after a few months of learning. I can create something that people will enjoy and interact with(hope so, again). Would love to get any response from you in Twitter or Telegram! Thanks!

Width and Height are required parameters
Max width and height value is 20, just because it's the most comfortable size for your eyes
Percentage is optional. If You don't enter it, game starts with a random value from 1% to 100%
There is a checker above the game field. It shows if game can be solved or not
If game can be solved, you will see a number of moves to solve a puzzle(fastest option)
If game can't be solved, please press 'Restart' button
Restart button will set a new field with the same parameters
If you want to set new parameters, click 'Main Menu' button
Main menu will move you to a first screen(by refreshing page, be carefull with your web connection
Hard mode covers 20% of field with additional holes. Be careful, it may shut down all routes to a hat
You can move your character using either arrows on the screen or arrow keys on your keyboard
